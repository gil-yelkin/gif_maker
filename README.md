This is the end-of-semester project of the second semester of the 'C programming' course in Magshimim.
In the last lesson of this semester we were asked to code a project that would create, edit, save and load GIFs using opencv (along with a detailed instructions and expectations .doc file). 
We had 10 days to do this project, and we had another project in the other Magshimim course to do at the same time.
This is the project I created, would love to hear your feedback!
